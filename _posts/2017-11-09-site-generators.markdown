# What do you think of static site generators?

What I think of static site generators, they're good for simple use, but personally, after going through all the trouble of setting it up, and the constantly running into problems while I was trying getting to run, it wasn't worth the bite, there are programs that offer similiar functionality as jekyll, why's this one so special? it's complicated, and the document available on the internet is not enough to cover the basics. This is too much for beginners like myself. Scss is completion to css, static site generators are not!

* What type of projects are they suitable for?

Blogging, but keep in mind, it can be a football fan blog, maybe news blogg for a community or personal blogg, thats my personal opinion, there is no information on google for what they are specifically used for.
