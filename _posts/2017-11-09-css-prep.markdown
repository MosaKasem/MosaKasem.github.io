# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?



1. Compare to regular css
2. Which techniques did you use?
3. Pros and cons?

**1a.** It's exactly the same as css, only you store values in a variable that starts with the dollar sign, and you link those variables to multiple css codes of your choice, easier to maintain in the long run.

**2a.** border, background, color (may have changed some due to error)

**3a.** __Cons__: More code, __pros:__ cleaner ui, coming from css, i found inlines to be much easier to understand, like this example `body {color: red;}`.
