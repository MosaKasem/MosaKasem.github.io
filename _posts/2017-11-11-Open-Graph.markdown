### What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

Identify our page when someone shares it on other socialmedia, think of it as a small container that holds a small piece of information. Think of statue that you see on the street, usually they contain a title `(name of the statue)` and under it a small description `(information)` about the statue.

ID can hold a :`name` and `typeof` and `url` and `image`. it doesnt have to have all these things but it's just a good way to present it in my opinion.
