### What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?



**What to put in it**


__The "/robots.txt" file is a text file, with one or more records. Usually contains a single record looking like this:__

{% highlight ruby %}

{% endhighlight %}

In this example, three directories are excluded.

**Dont forget**

Use all lower case for the filename: "robots.txt", not "Robots.TXT.
